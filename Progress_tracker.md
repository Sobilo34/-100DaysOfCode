# 100 Days Of Code -  Progress Tracker

## Day_01: Wed March 13, 2024 

**Language**: JavaScript

**Topic**:  Object, Scopes and Closures In JavaScript

**Notes:**

- A coding practice was done on my just completed Alx-Project on Objects, scopes and closures in JavaScript.
- Objects are special types of functions that makes coding easier with a defined way of coding.  
- It does what a function do in Procedural Oriented Programming
- Scopes in JS is what determines the accessibility and visibility of different variables, objects, and functions
- Closures are functions that encapsulate variables from their parent functions
- Many Live examples have been solved to explain the concept. View the codes in the link below:

**Challenges:**
I have no challenge

## Day_02: Thur March 14, 2024 

**Language**: C

**Topic**:  Pointers, Arrays and Strings

**Notes:**

- I revise the concept of Pointers, Arrays and Strings
- I revisit the projects that I did on it earlier 
-  I write a program to learn more about the concept
-  The program receives String for a User and prints out the ASCII value of it lowercase

**Challenges:**
I have network Isuue which makes me to submit lately. The network Issue is common to all Nigerians today ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Day_03: Fri March 15, 2024 

**Language**: Python

**Topic**: Conditional Statements (If...Else Statements)

**Notes:**

- I revise conditional statements in python particularly If...else statement
- I built a BMI calculator for an individulal user
- The full meaning of BMI is Body Mass Index
- It return the person's weight(kg) divided by square of his height(m)
- Formula for BMI = weight(kg) / height(m) ** 2
- The Program categorizes each individuals to Underweight, Normal weight, Obesed and Clinically Obesed with respect to their BMI 

**Challenges:**
I also have network Isuue which makes me to submit lately. The network Issue is common to all Nigerians

## Day_04: Sat March 16, 2024 

**Language**: C

**Topic**: Conditional Statements (More If...Else Statements)

**Notes:**

- I revise conditional statements in C language particularly If...else statement
- I built a leap hear calculator with C
- If a year (a particular value) is being given to the program, it will calculates if it's a leap year or not.
- It will then give message to the user telling if it's a leap year or not 

**Challenges:**
The network Isuue still persist which makes me to submit lately. It's really affecting my progress
